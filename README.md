# Intermediate Javascript - Password Generator (Assignment for a Front-End Web Development Bootcamp)

This project is a submission for a challenge to create a Random Password generator




# Acceptance Criteria
Your application must:

Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password:

At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

Character types:

Lowercase

Uppercase

Numeric

Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.


# Challenges 
I struggled for a little while to get the for loop exactly right to ensure that the user enters the appropriate number of characters to be used for a password


 
# Things I learned

One of my biggest takeaways from this challenge is that you have to be careful about where you define your variables as there was a point where I had defined a variable both in and outside of a function and it stopped the 'generate password' button from working.
